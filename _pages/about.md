The SMILES-X package is developed by the Data Assisted Materials Design group at the National Institute for Materials Science back since 2019. The underlying architecture has been described in detail in the original paper available [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ab57f3). 

The aim of the documentation is to familiarize users with the software's operation and give concrete usage examples.
